# AI Image Reference Editor

An advanced web application that utilizes the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview`) to perform complex image editing tasks. Users can edit a base image by providing a combination of text prompts, style reference images, and pose reference sketches or images. User authentication is securely handled via Google Sign-In.

- **Pose Replication**: Guide the subject's pose using a simple hand-drawn sketch or reference photos.
- **Camera Angle Control**: Adjust the perspective with intuitive controls like 'Zoom In', 'Low Angle', and 'Turn Around'.
- **Secure Authentication**: User access is managed through a seamless Google Sign-In flow.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and responsive interface built with React and Tailwind CSS.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-image-editor.git
    cd ai-image-editor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```
    Open your browser and navigate to the local URL provided by your development server.

### üìù Configuration Note

This project is set up to run without any initial configuration files. However, to enable the core features, you will need to configure two things:

-   **Google Sign-In**: To make the login functional, you must replace the placeholder Google Client ID in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` with your own. You can obtain one from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
-   **Gemini API**: The application requires a Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable (`API_KEY`) in its deployment environment. For local development, you would typically use a tool like `dotenv` and a `.env.local` file. You can get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).

## üïπÔ∏è How to Use the App

1.  **Sign In**: Click the "Sign in with Google" button to authenticate (requires Client ID configuration).
2.  **Upload Base Image**: Start by uploading the main image you want to edit. This is a required step.
3.  **Provide Instructions**: Use any combination of the following optional inputs:
    *   **Prompt**: Describe the changes you want to see (e.g., "turn the cat into an astronaut").
    *   **Style References**: Upload one or more images to define the artistic style.
    *   **Pose References**: Draw a stick figure in the canvas or upload images to guide the subject's pose.
    *   **Camera Angle**: Select an option like "Zoom In" or "High Angle" for a different perspective.
4.  **Generate**: Click the **"Generate Images"** button.
5.  **View and Download**: The AI will generate four edited images. You can preview them and hover over any image to download it.
